    <h2>Core Philosophy & Approach</h2>

    <blockquote class="featured-quote">
        "Atherosclerosis is fundamentally an inflammatory disease. Cholesterol deposits in arteries trigger an immune response, and inflammation destabilizes plaques, causing them to rupture and trigger heart attacks. Understanding this has opened new therapeutic targets beyond just lowering cholesterol."
    </blockquote>

    <p>Dr. Peter Libby is one of the most influential cardiovascular researchers of the past 40 years. His work has fundamentally changed how we understand atherosclerosis - from viewing it as simple cholesterol accumulation to recognizing it as an inflammatory disease involving complex immune responses.</p>

    <p>His research has opened new therapeutic frontiers, including anti-inflammatory approaches to preventing heart attacks that go beyond cholesterol lowering.</p>

    <div class="key-point">
        <h3>Central Arguments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Inflammation is key</strong> - Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease, not just cholesterol buildup</li>
            <li><strong>Immune system involvement</strong> - Immune cells play central roles in plaque formation and rupture</li>
            <li><strong>Plaque vulnerability</strong> - What makes a plaque rupture is as important as plaque size</li>
            <li><strong>Beyond cholesterol</strong> - Anti-inflammatory treatments represent a new frontier in CVD prevention</li>
            <li><strong>Translational research</strong> - Basic science discoveries can lead to new treatments</li>
        </ul>
