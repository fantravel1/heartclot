    <h2>Core Philosophy & Approach</h2>

    <blockquote class="featured-quote">
        "Fasting triggers a remarkable cellular cleanup process. Old, damaged cells are cleared away, and when you refeed, stem cells are activated to regenerate new tissue. This has profound implications for cardiovascular health, metabolic disease, and aging itself."
    </blockquote>

    <p>Dr. Valter Longo is one of the world's leading researchers on longevity and the biological effects of fasting. His laboratory at USC has produced groundbreaking research on how periodic fasting can trigger cellular regeneration, reduce disease risk, and potentially extend lifespan.</p>

    <p>Unlike advocates of daily intermittent fasting, Dr. Longo focuses on periodic prolonged fasting (or fasting mimicking diets) done several times per year, which he believes provides the regenerative benefits while being more sustainable for most people.</p>

    <div class="key-point">
        <h3>Central Arguments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fasting triggers autophagy</strong> - Extended fasting activates cellular cleanup and recycling processes</li>
            <li><strong>Stem cell regeneration</strong> - Refeeding after fasting activates stem cells to generate new tissue</li>
            <li><strong>Fasting mimicking</strong> - A specific very low-calorie protocol can provide benefits of fasting while eating</li>
            <li><strong>Periodic vs. daily</strong> - Periodic extended fasts may be more beneficial than daily time-restricted eating</li>
            <li><strong>Longevity diet</strong> - A mostly plant-based, moderate protein diet combined with periodic fasting optimizes healthspan</li>
        </ul>
