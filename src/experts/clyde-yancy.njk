    <h2>Core Philosophy & Approach</h2>

    <blockquote class="featured-quote">
        "Heart failure disproportionately affects Black Americans, and the outcomes are worse. But this isn't inevitable biology - it's avoidable disparity. We need to get upstream: control hypertension earlier, address social determinants, and ensure equal access to guideline-directed therapy."
    </blockquote>

    <p>Dr. Clyde Yancy is one of the most influential cardiologists in America, known for his expertise in heart failure and his leadership in addressing cardiovascular health disparities. As past president of the American Heart Association and a key author of heart failure treatment guidelines, he has shaped both clinical practice and policy.</p>

    <p>He emphasizes that racial disparities in heart disease are not inevitable but result from differences in prevention, access to care, and treatment intensity that can be addressed through deliberate action.</p>

    <div class="key-point">
        <h3>Central Arguments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Disparities are addressable</strong> - Racial gaps in cardiovascular outcomes can be closed with proper intervention</li>
            <li><strong>Hypertension is key</strong> - Earlier, more aggressive blood pressure control could prevent much heart disease in Black Americans</li>
            <li><strong>Guideline-directed therapy</strong> - All patients deserve access to evidence-based heart failure treatment</li>
            <li><strong>Workforce diversity</strong> - More diverse healthcare providers improve outcomes for minority patients</li>
            <li><strong>Social determinants matter</strong> - Healthcare alone cannot solve health disparities without addressing social conditions</li>
        </ul>
