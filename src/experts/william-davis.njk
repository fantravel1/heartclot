    <h2>Core Philosophy & Approach</h2>

    <blockquote class="featured-quote">
        "Modern wheat is not the wheat your grandmother ate. It's been hybridized into something our bodies don't recognize. It spikes blood sugar more than table sugar, triggers inflammation, and creates the small, dense LDL particles that actually cause heart disease."
    </blockquote>

    <p>Dr. William Davis is a preventive cardiologist who became one of the most prominent voices challenging conventional dietary guidance. His bestselling book "Wheat Belly" argues that modern wheat - not just gluten, but the entire grain - is a major driver of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.</p>

    <p>Dr. Davis emphasizes the importance of advanced lipid testing beyond standard cholesterol panels, particularly looking at LDL particle number and size. He advocates for patient empowerment and reducing dependence on the medical system through lifestyle optimization.</p>

    <div class="key-point">
        <h3>Central Arguments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Modern wheat is different</strong> - Decades of hybridization created a grain our bodies weren't designed to process</li>
            <li><strong>Small dense LDL matters</strong> - Particle size and number are more important than total LDL cholesterol</li>
            <li><strong>Glycemic impact</strong> - Whole wheat raises blood sugar more than white bread or even table sugar</li>
            <li><strong>Beyond gluten</strong> - The problem with wheat extends far beyond gluten sensitivity</li>
            <li><strong>Patient empowerment</strong> - People can take control of their health without constant medical intervention</li>
        </ul>
