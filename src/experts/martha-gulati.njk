    <h2>Core Philosophy & Approach</h2>

    <blockquote class="featured-quote">
        "We've been using exercise stress test criteria developed for men and applying them to women - and wondering why we get so many false positives. Women have different normal values, different symptoms, and need different approaches. It's not one-size-fits-all medicine."
    </blockquote>

    <p>Dr. Martha Gulati is one of America's leading advocates for sex-specific cardiovascular care. Her research has shown that standard cardiac tests and risk assessments often fail to accurately predict heart disease in women because they were developed using predominantly male study populations.</p>

    <p>She has been instrumental in developing female-specific criteria for exercise stress testing and advocating for prevention strategies tailored to women's unique risk factors, including pregnancy complications and menopause.</p>

    <div class="key-point">
        <h3>Central Arguments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sex-specific testing needed</strong> - Standard cardiac tests underperform in women because criteria were developed for men</li>
            <li><strong>Exercise capacity differs</strong> - Women have different normal values for exercise stress tests</li>
            <li><strong>Prevention is key</strong> - Women benefit enormously from aggressive prevention strategies</li>
            <li><strong>Risk factors differ</strong> - Pregnancy complications and autoimmune diseases are important cardiac risk factors in women</li>
            <li><strong>Patient education matters</strong> - Women need to know their symptoms may be different and advocate for themselves</li>
        </ul>
