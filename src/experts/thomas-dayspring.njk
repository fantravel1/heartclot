    <h2>Core Philosophy & Approach</h2>

    <blockquote class="featured-quote">
        "LDL cholesterol is a flawed metric. What actually matters is the number of LDL particles (LDL-P) or apoB. Two people with identical LDL-C can have dramatically different particle counts - and dramatically different risks. We need to stop treating a number and start understanding the actual pathophysiology."
    </blockquote>

    <p>Dr. Thomas Dayspring is arguably the most respected lipidologist in America, having spent decades educating physicians on the nuances of lipid metabolism that standard cholesterol panels miss. His work has fundamentally changed how advanced practitioners approach cardiovascular risk assessment.</p>

    <p>Dr. Dayspring emphasizes that the standard lipid panel (total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides) provides incomplete information. He champions the use of apoB, LDL particle number (LDL-P), and advanced lipid subfraction testing to more accurately assess risk and guide treatment.</p>

    <div class="key-point">
        <h3>Central Arguments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>ApoB superiority</strong> - ApoB or LDL-P are better predictors of cardiovascular risk than LDL-C</li>
            <li><strong>Discordance matters</strong> - When LDL-C and LDL-P disagree, particle count predicts risk better</li>
            <li><strong>Understanding pathophysiology</strong> - Treating numbers without understanding the underlying biology leads to poor outcomes</li>
            <li><strong>Individual variation</strong> - Lipid metabolism varies enormously between individuals</li>
            <li><strong>Education is key</strong> - Physicians need much better training in lipid science</li>
        </ul>

<section class="expert-concepts">
    <h2>Key Concepts from Dr. Dayspring</h2>

    <div class="concept-list">
        <div class="concept-item">
            <h3>LDL Particle Number (LDL-P)</h3>
            <p>The actual number of LDL particles, measured by NMR spectroscopy. More predictive of risk than LDL cholesterol content.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-item">
            <h3>ApoB</h3>
            <p>Apolipoprotein B-100, one molecule per atherogenic particle. Directly measures all particles that can enter the artery wall.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-item">
            <h3>Discordance</h3>
            <p>When LDL-C and LDL-P don't match. In discordant cases, particle number predicts cardiovascular events better than cholesterol content.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-item">
            <h3>Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)]</h3>
            <p>A genetically determined, highly atherogenic particle that standard panels don't measure. An independent causal risk factor.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-item">
            <h3>Remnant Lipoproteins</h3>
            <p>Partially metabolized VLDL particles that are highly atherogenic and often elevated in metabolic syndrome.</p>
