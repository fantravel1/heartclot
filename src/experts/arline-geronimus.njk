    <h2>Core Philosophy & Approach</h2>

    <blockquote class="featured-quote">
        "Weathering describes how chronic stress from discrimination accelerates biological aging. Black women at age 40 have the biological age of white women at 50. This isn't about genetics or individual behavior - it's about what structural racism does to bodies over time. Heart disease is one manifestation."
    </blockquote>

    <p>Dr. Arline Geronimus is a public health researcher whose work has fundamentally changed how we understand health disparities. Her "weathering hypothesis" proposes that the chronic stress of living with racism and discrimination causes accelerated biological aging, leading to earlier onset of chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease.</p>

    <p>Unlike approaches that focus on individual behaviors, Dr. Geronimus emphasizes that health disparities are rooted in social and structural conditions that must be addressed at a systemic level.</p>

    <div class="key-point">
        <h3>Central Arguments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Weathering is biological</strong> - Chronic stress causes measurable cellular and physiological aging</li>
            <li><strong>Allostatic load</strong> - Repeated stress activation leads to wear and tear on body systems</li>
            <li><strong>Not individual behavior</strong> - Health disparities cannot be explained by lifestyle choices alone</li>
            <li><strong>Structural solutions needed</strong> - Addressing disparities requires changing social conditions, not just healthcare</li>
            <li><strong>Lived experience matters</strong> - Research must center the experiences of marginalized communities</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>

    <div class="concept-list">
        <div class="concept-item">
            <h3>Weathering</h3>
            <p>The hypothesis that the chronic stress of marginalization leads to accelerated biological aging, resulting in earlier onset of chronic disease and premature mortality.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-item">
            <h3>Allostatic Load</h3>
            <p>The cumulative physiological "wear and tear" from repeated stress responses, measurable through biomarkers like cortisol, inflammatory markers, and cardiovascular measures.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-item">
            <h3>Biological Age vs. Chronological Age</h3>
            <p>The concept that people of the same age can have very different biological ages depending on their stress exposure and social conditions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-item">
            <h3>High-Effort Coping</h3>
            <p>"John Henryism" - the psychological and physiological cost of sustained high effort to overcome barriers and discrimination.</p>
