    <h2>Core Philosophy & Approach</h2>

    <blockquote class="featured-quote">
        "Small, dense LDL particles are more atherogenic than large, buoyant LDL. Diet dramatically affects which type you produce. A low-fat, high-carb diet often shifts the pattern toward smaller, more dangerous particles - the opposite of what we intended."
    </blockquote>

    <p>Dr. Ronald Krauss is one of the most influential lipid researchers of the past 50 years. His discovery that LDL particles come in different sizes - and that these sizes have different risk implications - fundamentally changed our understanding of cholesterol and heart disease.</p>

    <p>His research has shown that dietary recommendations to reduce fat and increase carbohydrates often shift LDL particle patterns toward the smaller, denser, more atherogenic type - a finding with profound implications for nutrition policy.</p>

    <div class="key-point">
        <h3>Central Arguments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>LDL size matters</strong> - Small, dense LDL particles are more dangerous than large, buoyant ones</li>
            <li><strong>Pattern A vs B</strong> - Individuals have predominant patterns of either large (A) or small (B) LDL particles</li>
            <li><strong>Diet affects particle size</strong> - High-carbohydrate diets shift patterns toward smaller, denser particles</li>
            <li><strong>Saturated fat nuance</strong> - Saturated fat effects depend on context and baseline metabolic health</li>
            <li><strong>Precision nutrition</strong> - Optimal diet varies by individual metabolic profile</li>
        </ul>
