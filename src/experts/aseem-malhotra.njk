    <p>Dr. Aseem Malhotra is a British cardiologist who has become one of the most outspoken critics of over-medication in cardiology. He argues that the medical profession has been "inadvertently harming patients" by over-prescribing medications while ignoring the root causes of heart disease - particularly diet and lifestyle factors.</p>

    <p>His work has been both influential and controversial, challenging pharmaceutical industry practices and calling for diet to be the first-line treatment for metabolic disease.</p>

    <h2>Key Arguments</h2>

    <div class="key-point">
        <h3>Core Message</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "The medical profession has been inadvertently harming patients for decades by not telling them the truth about what really causes heart disease and by over-prescribing medications with modest benefits and significant side effects. Diet is more powerful than any drug."
        </blockquote>
    </div>

    <h3>Key Positions</h3>

    <h4>1. Statins Are Over-Prescribed</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Absolute benefit is often small, especially for primary prevention</li>
        <li>Side effects are more common than acknowledged</li>
        <li>Industry-funded trials may overstate benefits</li>
        <li>Lifestyle changes can be more effective</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Sugar, Not Fat, Is the Problem</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Saturated fat has been wrongly demonized</li>
        <li>Sugar and refined carbohydrates drive metabolic disease</li>
        <li>Low-fat dietary guidelines were a mistake</li>
        <li>Food industry has influenced nutrition science</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Diet Should Be First-Line Treatment</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Mediterranean diet can reduce heart attacks more than statins</li>
        <li>Type 2 diabetes is often reversible with diet</li>
        <li>Lifestyle medicine should precede pharmaceutical intervention</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="warning-box">
        <h3>Controversial Positions</h3>
        <p>Some of Dr. Malhotra's views are considered controversial by mainstream cardiology organizations. His criticisms of statins, in particular, have been disputed by other experts who argue that the benefits of these medications are well-established for appropriate patient populations. Readers should evaluate the evidence and consult their own physicians.</p>
