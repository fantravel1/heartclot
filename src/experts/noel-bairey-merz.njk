    <p>Dr. C. Noel Bairey Merz is one of the world's leading authorities on heart disease in women. Her research has fundamentally changed how we understand, diagnose, and treat cardiovascular disease in women - revealing that women often have different disease patterns that standard tests miss.</p>

    <p>As director of the Barbra Streisand Women's Heart Center at Cedars-Sinai, she leads research and clinical programs dedicated to closing the gap in women's cardiac care.</p>

    <h2>Groundbreaking Research</h2>

    <div class="key-point">
        <h3>Core Message</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "Women's heart disease doesn't look like the textbook pictures - because the textbooks were written about men. Women have microvascular disease, coronary spasm, and plaque erosion more often than men. Our diagnostic tests miss these patterns. We need to stop calling women's symptoms 'atypical' - they're typical for women."
        </blockquote>
    </div>

    <h3>Key Discoveries</h3>

    <h4>1. Microvascular Coronary Disease</h4>
    <p>Dr. Bairey Merz's team discovered that many women with chest pain and abnormal stress tests have disease in the small vessels of the heart (microvasculature) rather than large artery blockages. This explains why:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Women's angiograms often look "clean" despite real disease</li>
        <li>Standard treatments may not work as well in women</li>
        <li>Women are often told "it's not your heart" when it actually is</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Coronary Microvascular Dysfunction (CMD)</h4>
    <p>The small vessels that feed the heart muscle can become dysfunctional, causing:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chest pain and shortness of breath</li>
        <li>Reduced blood flow during stress</li>
        <li>Heart damage over time</li>
        <li>Increased risk of heart failure and heart attack</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. INOCA - Ischemia with No Obstructive Coronary Arteries</h4>
    <p>Dr. Bairey Merz helped define this condition where patients have signs of inadequate blood flow (ischemia) but no significant blockages on angiogram. It affects more women than men.</p>

    <div class="warning-box">
        <h3>The Diagnostic Gap</h3>
        <p>Traditional cardiac testing was developed studying men with large artery blockages. Women are more likely to have diffuse disease, microvascular dysfunction, and coronary spasm - none of which show up on standard angiograms. This leads to underdiagnosis and undertreatment.</p>
    </div>
</section>

<section id="wise-study">
    <h2>The WISE Study</h2>

    <p>The <strong>Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (WISE)</strong> study is a landmark NIH-funded research program that Dr. Bairey Merz has led for over two decades.</p>

    <h3>Key WISE Findings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Women have different disease:</strong> Microvascular disease, diffuse plaque, and coronary spasm are more common in women</li>
        <li><strong>Normal angiograms don't mean normal:</strong> Women with symptoms and "clean" angiograms still have increased mortality</li>
        <li><strong>Different symptoms:</strong> Fatigue, shortness of breath, and non-chest symptoms are common</li>
        <li><strong>Hormonal factors:</strong> Estrogen loss accelerates cardiovascular aging</li>
        <li><strong>New tests needed:</strong> Coronary flow reserve and microvascular testing identify disease missed by angiography</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact on Clinical Practice</h3>
    <p>WISE research has led to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Recognition of INOCA as a real disease entity</li>
        <li>Development of new diagnostic tests for microvascular disease</li>
        <li>Updated guidelines for evaluating women with chest pain</li>
        <li>Better understanding of hormone therapy and heart disease</li>
    </ul>
