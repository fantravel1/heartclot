    <h2>Core Philosophy & Approach</h2>

    <blockquote class="featured-quote">
        "Much of what we were taught in medical school about nutrition was based on weak evidence and food industry influence. When I started questioning these assumptions and trying ancestral approaches with my patients, I saw metabolic disease reverse in ways I'd never seen with conventional advice."
    </blockquote>

    <p>Dr. Ken Berry is a family physician who has become one of the most popular health educators on YouTube, with over 3 million subscribers. He advocates for low-carbohydrate and carnivore dietary approaches, often challenging conventional medical advice.</p>

    <p>His book "Lies My Doctor Told Me" critiques common medical recommendations he believes are based on weak evidence or industry influence. He emphasizes ancestral eating patterns and questions modern dietary guidelines.</p>

    <div class="warning-box">
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Some of Dr. Berry's views, particularly on carnivore diets, are considered extreme by mainstream medicine and nutrition science. While many of his followers report benefits, long-term studies on all-meat diets are limited. Always consult your physician before making significant dietary changes.</p>

            <li><strong>Industry influence</strong> - Food and pharmaceutical industries have shaped dietary guidelines</li>
            <li><strong>Patient empowerment</strong> - People should research and advocate for their own health</li>
