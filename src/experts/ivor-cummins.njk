    <h2>Core Philosophy & Approach</h2>

    <blockquote class="featured-quote">
        "The CAC score tells you the actual disease burden - whether calcium is in your arteries. LDL cholesterol is a surrogate marker with huge limitations. Engineers are trained to focus on root causes and actual outcomes, not proxy measurements."
    </blockquote>

    <p>Ivor Cummins brings an engineer's perspective to cardiovascular disease, emphasizing root cause analysis and direct measurement over surrogate markers. After being diagnosed with metabolic syndrome, he applied his problem-solving skills to understanding heart disease, eventually becoming a prominent voice in the low-carb community.</p>

    <p>He is particularly known for advocating coronary artery calcium (CAC) scanning as a direct measure of arterial disease, arguing it provides more actionable information than cholesterol testing.</p>

    <div class="warning-box">
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Ivor Cummins is an engineer, not a physician. His analyses are thoughtful and detailed, but should be considered alongside medical expertise. Always consult healthcare providers for medical decisions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="key-point">
        <h3>Central Arguments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CAC score is superior</strong> - Direct imaging of arterial calcification beats cholesterol testing for risk assessment</li>
            <li><strong>Insulin is the master hormone</strong> - Hyperinsulinemia drives most chronic disease</li>
            <li><strong>Root cause focus</strong> - Engineering principles applied to health emphasize addressing causes, not symptoms</li>
            <li><strong>LDL-C is a poor marker</strong> - LDL cholesterol alone doesn't accurately predict cardiovascular risk</li>
            <li><strong>Systems thinking</strong> - The body is a complex system requiring holistic analysis</li>
        </ul>
