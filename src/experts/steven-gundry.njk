    <h2>Core Philosophy & Approach</h2>

    <blockquote class="featured-quote">
        "Heart disease is an inflammatory condition. The inflammation often starts in the gut with damage from lectins and other plant compounds. When I stopped focusing on cholesterol and started focusing on gut health and inflammation, my patients' outcomes transformed."
    </blockquote>

    <p>Dr. Steven Gundry performed thousands of complex heart surgeries as one of the premier cardiothoracic surgeons in the country. His career transformed when he met a patient who reversed severe coronary artery disease through diet - something Gundry had been taught was impossible.</p>

    <p>This encounter led him to transition from operating on diseased hearts to preventing heart disease through nutrition and lifestyle intervention. His research focused particularly on lectins - plant proteins that he believes contribute to inflammation, gut damage, and chronic disease.</p>

    <div class="key-point">
        <h3>Central Arguments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lectins as culprits</strong> - Plant defense proteins (lectins) damage the gut lining and trigger systemic inflammation</li>
            <li><strong>Gut-heart connection</strong> - Intestinal permeability leads to immune activation and cardiovascular inflammation</li>
            <li><strong>Not all plants are equal</strong> - Some plant foods are beneficial while others (especially grains and legumes) are harmful</li>
            <li><strong>The microbiome matters</strong> - Feeding beneficial gut bacteria is key to health</li>
            <li><strong>Longevity focus</strong> - Diet and lifestyle can dramatically extend healthspan and lifespan</li>
        </ul>
