    <h2>Core Philosophy & Approach</h2>

    <blockquote class="featured-quote">
        "Every organ in your body has a clock, and they're all synchronized to expect food at certain times. When you eat outside your metabolic window - late at night, for example - you're fighting your biology. Time-restricted eating isn't about eating less, it's about eating in sync with your body."
    </blockquote>

    <p>Dr. Satchin Panda is one of the world's leading researchers on circadian rhythms - the internal clocks that govern nearly every aspect of our physiology. His research has shown that WHEN we eat may be as important as WHAT we eat for metabolic health.</p>

    <p>His work on time-restricted eating (TRE) demonstrates that confining food intake to a consistent 8-12 hour window aligned with daylight can improve metabolic markers, reduce inflammation, and potentially reduce cardiovascular risk - even without changing what you eat.</p>

    <div class="key-point">
        <h3>Central Arguments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Circadian rhythms are fundamental</strong> - Every cell and organ has internal clocks that coordinate metabolic function</li>
            <li><strong>Eating windows matter</strong> - Confining eating to 8-12 hours improves metabolic health</li>
            <li><strong>Light exposure is key</strong> - Morning light and evening darkness are essential for circadian health</li>
            <li><strong>Modern life disrupts rhythms</strong> - Late eating, artificial light, and irregular schedules cause metabolic dysfunction</li>
            <li><strong>Timing over content</strong> - When you eat affects metabolism independent of calorie content</li>
        </ul>
