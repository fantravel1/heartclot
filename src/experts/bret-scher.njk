    <h2>Core Philosophy & Approach</h2>

    <blockquote class="featured-quote">
        "As a cardiologist, I was trained to prescribe medications. But when I started using low-carb nutrition as a first-line treatment, I saw results that no medication could match. We need to integrate metabolic health into mainstream cardiology, not treat it as alternative medicine."
    </blockquote>

    <p>Dr. Bret Scher represents a new generation of cardiologists integrating metabolic health principles into conventional cardiology practice. Unlike many low-carb advocates who come from outside mainstream medicine, Dr. Scher brings conventional cardiology training and credentials while advocating for dietary intervention as first-line treatment.</p>

    <p>His work focuses on bridging the gap between low-carb research and clinical cardiology, providing evidence-based guidance that physicians can use in practice. He emphasizes that low-carb nutrition isn't "alternative medicine" but rather a well-supported therapeutic approach.</p>

    <div class="key-point">
        <h3>Central Arguments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Diet before drugs</strong> - Lifestyle intervention should be the first treatment for most metabolic conditions</li>
            <li><strong>Evidence-based low-carb</strong> - Low-carbohydrate diets have strong research support for metabolic health</li>
            <li><strong>Nuanced lipid interpretation</strong> - Standard cholesterol panels need context; metabolic health matters</li>
            <li><strong>Physician education</strong> - Doctors need better training in nutrition and metabolic health</li>
            <li><strong>Patient empowerment</strong> - People can achieve remarkable health improvements through dietary changes</li>
