    <h2>Core Philosophy & Approach</h2>

    <blockquote class="featured-quote">
        "There's more agreement in nutrition than the headlines suggest. Whether you look at Mediterranean, plant-based, or even well-constructed low-carb diets, they share common features: real food, mostly plants, not too much. We're letting the perfect be the enemy of the good."
    </blockquote>

    <p>Dr. David Katz is a unique voice in nutrition because he focuses on what different dietary approaches have in common rather than what divides them. Through the True Health Initiative, he has brought together hundreds of nutrition experts to identify areas of consensus.</p>

    <p>He argues that the endless diet wars distract from fundamental principles that virtually all experts agree upon: eating whole foods, minimizing ultra-processed foods, and emphasizing plants - regardless of whether someone follows a Mediterranean, vegan, or low-carb approach.</p>

    <div class="key-point">
        <h3>Central Arguments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consensus exists</strong> - Despite headlines, there's broad agreement on dietary fundamentals</li>
            <li><strong>Real food matters most</strong> - The shared feature of healthy diets is whole, minimally processed foods</li>
            <li><strong>Diet wars are counterproductive</strong> - Fighting over details prevents action on what we know works</li>
            <li><strong>Lifestyle is medicine</strong> - Diet, exercise, sleep, and stress management can treat and prevent chronic disease</li>
            <li><strong>Public health focus</strong> - Individual diet choices must be considered in the context of population health and sustainability</li>
        </ul>
