    <h2>Core Philosophy & Approach</h2>

    <blockquote class="featured-quote">
        "The cholesterol hypothesis has never been proven - it's been assumed. Heart disease is about damage to the endothelium and failed repair, not about cholesterol floating in the blood. We've been chasing the wrong target for 50 years while ignoring the real causes."
    </blockquote>

    <p>Dr. Malcolm Kendrick is one of the most prominent critics of the cholesterol hypothesis of heart disease. For decades, he has argued that the evidence linking cholesterol to heart disease is far weaker than commonly believed, and that the focus on cholesterol has diverted attention from true causes.</p>

    <p>His alternative theory focuses on endothelial damage and dysfunction, blood clotting abnormalities, and failure of the repair process as the fundamental mechanisms of atherosclerosis.</p>

    <div class="warning-box">
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Dr. Kendrick's views are considered controversial by mainstream cardiology. His critiques have sparked debate but are not widely accepted by medical institutions. Readers should evaluate the evidence carefully and consult their own physicians.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="key-point">
        <h3>Central Arguments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cholesterol doesn't cause heart disease</strong> - The diet-heart hypothesis lacks consistent supporting evidence</li>
            <li><strong>Endothelial damage is key</strong> - Heart disease starts with damage to the artery lining, not cholesterol infiltration</li>
            <li><strong>Clotting mechanisms</strong> - Blood clots forming on damaged endothelium are incorporated into plaques</li>
            <li><strong>Repair failure</strong> - Atherosclerosis represents failed attempts to repair arterial damage</li>
            <li><strong>Statin concerns</strong> - The benefits of statins are exaggerated and side effects underreported</li>
        </ul>
