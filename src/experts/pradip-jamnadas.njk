    <p>Dr. Pradip Jamnadas is a board-certified interventional cardiologist who has spent over three decades treating heart disease. His clinical experience with over 30,000 cardiac procedures has led him to challenge conventional approaches to cardiovascular health, particularly the focus on cholesterol as the primary driver of heart disease.</p>

    <p>His viral appearance on "The Diary of a CEO" podcast brought his message about insulin resistance and metabolic health to millions of viewers worldwide, making complex cardiology concepts accessible to the general public.</p>

    <h2>Medical Philosophy</h2>

    <div class="key-point">
        <h3>Core Belief</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "After 35 years in cardiology, I've discovered that everything we've been told about heart disease is incomplete. The real killers? Insulin resistance, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunction. We've been treating symptoms while ignoring root causes."
        </blockquote>
    </div>

    <h3>Key Principles</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Insulin resistance is the root cause</strong> - Not cholesterol, but metabolic dysfunction drives heart disease</li>
        <li><strong>Test fasting insulin, not just glucose</strong> - Standard tests miss the problem for years</li>
        <li><strong>Fasting is therapeutic</strong> - Time-restricted eating can reverse metabolic damage</li>
        <li><strong>Food is medicine</strong> - Dietary changes are more powerful than most medications</li>
        <li><strong>Prevention over intervention</strong> - Stop the disease before it requires procedures</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Case That Changed Everything</h3>
    <p>Dr. Jamnadas frequently references a 28-year-old patient who suffered a massive heart attack despite "normal" blood sugar. This case crystallized his understanding that insulin resistance - not diabetes - was the hidden driver. The patient's glucose tests were fine, but his insulin levels were destroying his arteries.</p>

    <h2>Key Concepts from Dr. Jamnadas</h2>

    <div class="concept-grid">
        <div class="concept-card">
            <h3>The Insulin-Heart Connection</h3>
            <p>High insulin levels damage arteries directly, independent of blood sugar. This is why 50% of heart attack victims are pre-diabetic, not diabetic - their glucose looks fine while insulin is destroying them.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="concept-card">
            <h3>Therapeutic Fasting</h3>
            <p>Fasting is the most powerful tool for lowering insulin and reversing metabolic damage. Dr. Jamnadas recommends starting with 16:8 time-restricted eating and progressing to longer fasts.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="concept-card">
            <h3>The Coronary Calcium Score</h3>
            <p>The single best predictor of heart attack risk. A score of zero is highly reassuring; any calcium indicates disease is present and action is needed.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="concept-card">
            <h3>Visceral Fat</h3>
            <p>Belly fat is an active endocrine organ pumping out inflammatory molecules. It's the external sign of internal metabolic chaos - fatty liver, insulin resistance, and arterial damage.</p>
