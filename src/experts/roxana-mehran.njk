    <h2>Core Philosophy & Approach</h2>

    <blockquote class="featured-quote">
        "Pregnancy is a stress test for the heart. Women who develop preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, or deliver preterm have given us a window into their cardiovascular future. These aren't just pregnancy complications - they're cardiovascular risk factors that should follow a woman for life."
    </blockquote>

    <p>Dr. Roxana Mehran is one of the most prolific and cited cardiovascular researchers in the world. Her work spans interventional cardiology, bleeding complications, contrast-induced kidney injury, and women's cardiovascular health.</p>

    <p>She has been particularly influential in recognizing pregnancy complications as predictors of future cardiovascular disease, advocating for long-term follow-up of women who experience adverse pregnancy outcomes.</p>

    <div class="key-point">
        <h3>Central Arguments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pregnancy as a cardiac stress test</strong> - Complications during pregnancy reveal underlying cardiovascular vulnerability</li>
            <li><strong>Women in clinical trials</strong> - Cardiovascular trials must adequately represent women</li>
            <li><strong>Bleeding risk matters</strong> - Balancing bleeding and thrombotic risk requires sex-specific approaches</li>
            <li><strong>Long-term follow-up needed</strong> - Women with pregnancy complications need lifelong cardiovascular monitoring</li>
            <li><strong>Global health equity</strong> - Cardiovascular care must improve for women worldwide</li>
        </ul>
