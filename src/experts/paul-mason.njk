    <h2>Core Philosophy & Approach</h2>

    <blockquote class="featured-quote">
        "The advice to replace saturated fat with vegetable oils may be one of the greatest public health mistakes of the past 50 years. These industrial seed oils are inflammatory and oxidize easily. We've demonized traditional fats while promoting manufactured ones."
    </blockquote>

    <p>Dr. Paul Mason is a sports medicine physician who has become one of the most prominent voices in the low-carbohydrate movement, particularly in Australia. His presentations at Low Carb Down Under conferences have been viewed millions of times.</p>

    <p>He is particularly known for his detailed analysis of seed oils (vegetable oils) and their potential role in chronic disease, arguing that the shift from traditional fats to industrial seed oils has contributed to the rise in metabolic and cardiovascular disease.</p>

    <div class="warning-box">
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Some of Dr. Mason's views on seed oils and saturated fat are considered controversial by mainstream nutrition science. While his arguments are detailed and thought-provoking, readers should evaluate the evidence carefully.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="key-point">
        <h3>Central Arguments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Seed oils are problematic</strong> - Industrial vegetable oils are inflammatory and easily oxidized</li>
            <li><strong>Saturated fat rehabilitation</strong> - The evidence against saturated fat is weaker than commonly believed</li>
            <li><strong>Low-carb for metabolic health</strong> - Carbohydrate restriction is effective for metabolic syndrome</li>
            <li><strong>Dietary guidelines are flawed</strong> - Official nutrition advice is based on weak evidence</li>
            <li><strong>Traditional diets were healthier</strong> - Ancestral eating patterns avoided many modern health problems</li>
