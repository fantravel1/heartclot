    <h2>Core Philosophy & Approach</h2>

    <blockquote class="featured-quote">
        "Insulin resistance is the most common health disorder worldwide, yet most people have never heard of it. It's the common thread linking obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's, and even many cancers. If you want to prevent chronic disease, you must control insulin."
    </blockquote>

    <p>Dr. Benjamin Bikman is one of the world's leading researchers on the metabolic effects of insulin resistance. His laboratory at Brigham Young University focuses on understanding how insulin resistance develops at the cellular level and how it leads to chronic disease.</p>

    <p>Unlike many researchers who focus on glucose, Dr. Bikman emphasizes that elevated insulin - hyperinsulinemia - is the primary driver of metabolic dysfunction. He argues that by the time blood glucose becomes abnormal, insulin resistance has often been present for years or decades.</p>

    <div class="key-point">
        <h3>Central Arguments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Insulin as the master hormone</strong> - Elevated insulin drives fat storage, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunction throughout the body</li>
            <li><strong>Chronic disease connection</strong> - Insulin resistance underlies not just diabetes but heart disease, Alzheimer's, cancer, and more</li>
            <li><strong>Carbohydrate focus</strong> - Dietary carbohydrates are the primary driver of insulin secretion and thus insulin resistance</li>
            <li><strong>Ketones as fuel</strong> - The ketogenic state provides metabolic and cognitive benefits beyond weight loss</li>
            <li><strong>Exercise importance</strong> - Physical activity improves insulin sensitivity independent of weight loss</li>
        </ul>
