    <h2>Core Philosophy & Approach</h2>

    <blockquote class="featured-quote">
        "Heart disease need never exist, and if it does exist, it need never progress. A whole-food, plant-based diet without any added oil restores endothelial function and halts the disease process. We have the cure - it's just not a pill."
    </blockquote>

    <p>Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn spent decades as a surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic before shifting his focus to preventing and reversing heart disease through dietary intervention. His landmark 20+ year study demonstrated that patients with severe heart disease could halt and even reverse their condition through strict adherence to a whole-food, plant-based diet.</p>

    <p>His approach is notable for its strictness - no animal products, no added oils (including olive oil), and minimal processed foods. While demanding, patients who follow the protocol have shown remarkable results.</p>

    <div class="warning-box">
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Dr. Esselstyn's approach is significantly different from the metabolic/low-carb perspective of many experts on this site. His no-oil, whole-food plant-based protocol is very strict. Both approaches have shown benefits in motivated patients; the optimal approach may vary by individual.</p>

        <h3>Central Arguments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Heart disease is reversible</strong> - Dietary intervention can halt and reverse coronary artery disease</li>
            <li><strong>No oil</strong> - All oils, including olive oil, damage endothelial function</li>
            <li><strong>Endothelium is key</strong> - A healthy arterial lining prevents plaque formation</li>
            <li><strong>Plants only</strong> - All animal products contribute to vascular disease</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance is crucial</strong> - Partial adherence doesn't provide the same benefits</li>
        </ul>
