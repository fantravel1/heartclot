faqSchema:
  - question: "Can too much exercise damage your heart?"
    answer: "Yes, excessive endurance exercise can damage your heart. Marathon runners and ultra-endurance athletes often have more coronary artery calcification than sedentary people. Chronic excessive cardio causes oxidative stress, elevated cortisol, myocardial fibrosis (heart scarring), and atrial fibrillation. The sweet spot is 15-45 minutes of varied exercise, not hours of steady-state cardio."
  - question: "How much exercise is optimal for heart health?"
    answer: "For optimal heart health: 15-20 minutes of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) 3x per week, 20-30 minutes of resistance training 2-3x per week, and daily walking (8,000-10,000 steps). This produces better cardiovascular outcomes than hours of steady-state cardio. Exercise at the end of a fast maximizes benefits. More is not better - recovery is essential."
  - question: "What is the best type of exercise for heart disease prevention?"
    answer: "The best exercise protocol for heart health combines: HIIT (short bursts of intense effort followed by recovery), resistance training (builds muscle, improves insulin sensitivity), and daily walking. Avoid chronic long-duration cardio. Exercise in a fasted state when possible. Include recovery days. Focus on consistency over intensity - 15 minutes daily beats 2 hours on weekends."
  - question: "Should I exercise while fasting?"
    answer: "Yes, exercising at the end of a fast maximizes benefits. During fasting, your body burns fat for fuel and growth hormone is elevated. Exercising in this state enhances fat burning, improves insulin sensitivity, and amplifies autophagy. Start with light exercise while fasting; your body adapts over 2-3 weeks. Stay hydrated and break your fast with protein after exercise."

    <h4>🚨 The Exercise Paradox</h4>
    <p>People who exercise 2+ hours daily often have MORE coronary artery disease than those doing 15-20 minutes. After 35 years of cardiac surgery, the evidence is undeniable.</p>

    <h2>The Shocking Truth About Cardio</h2>

    <p>Everything you've been told about "cardio for heart health" is wrong. The patients with the most arterial calcification? Marathon runners and cycling enthusiasts.</p>

    <h3>What I See in My Practice</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Marathoners with severe coronary calcification</li>
        <li>100-mile cyclists with arterial plaques</li>
        <li>2-hour daily runners needing stents</li>
        <li>Gym addicts with heart attacks at 45</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Mechanisms of Damage</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Chronic inflammation:</strong> Excessive exercise = constant inflammatory state</li>
        <li><strong>Oxidative stress:</strong> More free radicals than antioxidants can handle</li>
        <li><strong>Gut ischemia:</strong> Blood diverted from gut → vagus damage</li>
        <li><strong>Cortisol elevation:</strong> Chronic stress hormone release</li>
        <li><strong>Electrolyte imbalances:</strong> Arrhythmia risk</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Why Chronic Cardio Fails</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rate-limiting cleanup:</strong> Can't clear metabolic waste fast enough</li>
        <li><strong>Glutathione depletion:</strong> Primary antioxidant exhausted</li>

    <h2>What Actually Works: The 15-Minute Solution</h2>

    <p>After treating 30,000+ hearts, the pattern is clear: short, intense efforts with complete recovery produce the healthiest cardiovascular systems.</p>

        <strong>The Magic Formula:</strong>

<section id="resistance">
    <h2>Resistance Training: The Missing Link</h2>

    <p>Most cardiac patients avoid weights. This is a mistake. Resistance training improves insulin sensitivity better than any cardio.</p>

    <h3>Simple Effective Exercises</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Push-ups:</strong> Full body engagement</li>
        <li><strong>Planks:</strong> Core and stability</li>
        <li><strong>Squats:</strong> Largest muscle groups</li>
        <li><strong>Lunges:</strong> Balance and strength</li>
        <li><strong>Pull-ups/rows:</strong> Upper body balance</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Flow Method</h3>
    <p>Move smoothly between exercises using body weight. No need for heavy weights or gym equipment.</p>

    <div class="exercise-box">
        <strong>Sample Flow Routine:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>10 push-ups</li>
            <li>20 squats</li>
            <li>30-second plank</li>
            <li>10 lunges each leg</li>
            <li>Rest 1 minute</li>

<section id="timing">
    <h2>Exercise Timing: The Fasting Advantage</h2>

    <p>WHEN you exercise matters as much as HOW. Exercise at the end of your fast for maximum benefit.</p>

    <h3>Why Fasted Exercise Works</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Growth hormone peak:</strong> 5x higher when fasted</li>
        <li><strong>Fat burning:</strong> Already in ketosis</li>
        <li><strong>Muscle preservation:</strong> Growth hormone protects</li>
        <li><strong>Mental clarity:</strong> Ketones fuel brain</li>
        <li><strong>Recovery enhanced:</strong> Less inflammation</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="exercise-box">
        <strong>Optimal Timing:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Breaking fast at 6 PM? Exercise at 4 PM</li>
            <li>16:8 fasting? Exercise hour 14-15</li>
            <li>OMAD? Exercise 2 hours before meal</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Women and Fasted Exercise</h3>
    <p>Some women may need light protein before intense exercise. Listen to your body. Start with less intense fasted workouts.</p>
</section>

<section id="weekly-plan">
    <h2>Your Optimal Weekly Exercise Plan</h2>

    <div class="protocol-card" style="max-width: 600px; margin: 2rem auto;">
        <h4>The Complete Week</h4>

        <p><strong>Monday:</strong> 15 min aerobic + 20 min resistance</p>
        <p><strong>Tuesday:</strong> 20 min HIIT</p>
        <p><strong>Wednesday:</strong> Rest or gentle walk</p>
        <p><strong>Thursday:</strong> 15 min aerobic + 20 min resistance</p>
        <p><strong>Friday:</strong> 20 min HIIT</p>
        <p><strong>Saturday:</strong> Flow exercises or yoga</p>
        <p><strong>Sunday:</strong> Complete rest</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Signs You're Overdoing It</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Resting heart rate increases</li>
        <li>Sleep quality decreases</li>
        <li>Constant fatigue</li>
        <li>Frequent illness</li>
        <li>Performance declining</li>
        <li>Mood changes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Minimum Effective Dose</h3>
    <p>You need surprisingly little exercise for optimal health:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>150 minutes/week moderate activity</strong></li>
        <li><strong>OR 75 minutes/week vigorous activity</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Plus 2 resistance sessions</strong></li>
        <li><strong>That's it. More isn't better.</strong></li>
    </ul>

        <h4>Remember This</h4>
