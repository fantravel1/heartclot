<section class="intro-section">
    <p>Heart disease research is evolving rapidly, with experts challenging long-held assumptions and exploring new paradigms. This page presents diverse perspectives from cardiologists, researchers, and thought leaders - some mainstream, some contrarian, all contributing to our understanding of cardiovascular health.</p>

    <div class="key-point">
        <h3>Why Diverse Perspectives Matter</h3>
        <p>Science advances through debate and the testing of competing hypotheses. We present experts with varying viewpoints not to create confusion, but to demonstrate that cardiovascular medicine is a dynamic field where new evidence continually reshapes understanding. Readers should evaluate evidence critically and consult their own healthcare providers.</p>

    <h2>Metabolic Health Pioneers</h2>
    <p>These experts have championed the role of insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction in heart disease, often before mainstream acceptance.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "After 35 years in cardiology, I've discovered that everything we've been told about heart disease is incomplete. The real killers are insulin resistance, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunction. The 28-year-old who came to me with a massive heart attack wasn't diabetic - his glucose was normal. But his insulin levels were destroying his arteries."

                "A calorie is not a calorie. The source matters. Fructose is metabolized differently than glucose - it goes straight to the liver where it's converted to fat, drives insulin resistance, and causes metabolic syndrome. This is the real cause of the obesity and heart disease epidemic."

    <h2>Making Sense of Diverse Perspectives</h2>

    <p>The experts on this page represent a range of viewpoints - some mainstream, some alternative, some in between. This diversity reflects the genuine complexity of cardiovascular science and the ongoing evolution of our understanding.</p>

    <div class="key-point">
        <h3>Common Ground</h3>
        <p>Despite disagreements, most experts agree on several points:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction are major cardiovascular risk factors</li>
            <li>Ultra-processed foods are harmful</li>
            <li>Lifestyle factors (diet, exercise, sleep, stress) powerfully affect heart disease risk</li>
            <li>Standard risk calculators have significant limitations</li>
            <li>Women and minorities have been underserved by cardiovascular research</li>
            <li>Inflammation plays a central role in atherosclerosis</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Use This Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Don't take any single expert's word as gospel</strong> - even experts disagree and can be wrong</li>
            <li><strong>Look for convergent evidence</strong> - where multiple independent sources agree</li>
            <li><strong>Consider your individual context</strong> - recommendations vary by age, health status, and risk factors</li>
            <li><strong>Work with your physician</strong> - use this information to have informed conversations, not to self-treat</li>
            <li><strong>Stay curious</strong> - the science is evolving, and today's contrarian view may be tomorrow's standard of care</li>
