  - question: "Why are vegetable oils bad for your heart?"
    answer: "Vegetable oils (soybean, corn, canola, sunflower) are high in omega-6 fatty acids which promote inflammation when consumed in excess. They oxidize easily when heated, creating harmful compounds. Modern diets have a 20:1 omega-6 to omega-3 ratio (should be 1:1), driving chronic inflammation - a primary cause of heart disease. Use olive oil, avocado oil, or animal fats instead."
  - question: "Is fruit bad for heart health because of the sugar?"
    answer: "Whole fruits are generally healthy due to fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants. However, fruit juice is problematic - it's concentrated fructose without fiber, spiking blood sugar like soda. For heart health, limit high-sugar fruits (grapes, mangoes, bananas), avoid dried fruits and juice entirely, and choose berries, which are lower in sugar and high in antioxidants."
  - question: "What foods should I eat for heart health?"
    answer: "Heart-healthy foods include: fatty fish (salmon, sardines, mackerel) for omega-3s, leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables, berries, nuts (especially walnuts and almonds), olive oil, avocados, eggs, and grass-fed meats. Focus on whole, unprocessed foods. Avoid refined carbs, vegetable oils, and processed foods. Eating within a time-restricted window enhances benefits."
  - question: "Does white bread really spike blood sugar as much as sugar?"
    answer: "Yes, white bread has a glycemic index of 75 - nearly as high as pure glucose (100). One slice of white bread spikes blood sugar equivalent to about 10 teaspoons of sugar. This rapid spike triggers an insulin surge, promoting fat storage, inflammation, and over time, insulin resistance. Whole grain bread is only marginally better. Reducing all refined carbs is key for heart health."

    <strong>Shocking Truth:</strong>
    One slice of white bread spikes your blood sugar as much as 10 teaspoons of pure sugar. Your "healthy" breakfast might be a heart attack on a plate.

    <h2>The Vegetable Oil Inflammation Bomb</h2>

    <p>The biggest scam in nutrition history: "heart-healthy" vegetable oils that are actually industrial waste products.</p>

    <div class="danger-box">
        <strong>The Omega-6 Disaster:</strong>
        Our ancestors had a 1:1 ratio of omega-6 to omega-3. Today's ratio? 20:1 or worse. This drives massive inflammation.

    <h3>Oils That Destroy</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Soybean oil:</strong> In everything, pure omega-6</li>
        <li><strong>Corn oil:</strong> Extracted with hexane (industrial solvent)</li>
        <li><strong>Canola oil:</strong> Highly processed, oxidizes easily</li>
        <li><strong>Sunflower oil:</strong> Unstable, creates aldehydes when heated</li>
        <li><strong>Safflower oil:</strong> 75% omega-6, pure inflammation</li>
        <li><strong>"Vegetable" oil:</strong> Mystery blend of the worst oils</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What Happens When You Heat These Oils</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Molecular structure breaks down</li>
        <li>Creates toxic aldehydes and oxidized lipids</li>
        <li>These damage arterial walls on contact</li>
